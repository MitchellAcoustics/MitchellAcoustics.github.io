When adapting these methods for cross-cultural applications, we encountered significant challenges with the normalization factors that ensure coordinates remain within the desired range. This paper presents a mathematically rigorous solution to these challenges, ensuring consistent normalization across different language adaptations of the ISO soundscape attributes.\n\n## Analysis of Existing Normalization Methods\n\n### Original ISO Direct Differences Method\n\nThe original method for calculating coordinates in the soundscape perceptual space was based on direct differences between opposing attributes:\n\n$$P = (p - a) + \\cos45° \\cdot (ca - ch) + \\cos45° \\cdot (v - m)$$\n$$E = (e - u) + \\cos45° \\cdot (ch - ca) + \\cos45° \\cdot (v - m)$$\n\nWhere:\n\n- p = pleasant, a = annoying\n- e = eventful, u = uneventful\n- ca = calm, ch = chaotic\n- v = vibrant, m = monotonous\n\nA scaling factor of $\\pm (4 + \\sqrt{32})$ was used to normalize the coordinates to the range [-1, +1]. This scaling factor represents the maximum possible contribution from all terms in the formula:\n\nFor a 5-point Likert scale (range 1-5), the maximum difference between opposing attributes is 4 (5-1). The direct opposition term contributes a maximum of 4 units, while each angled attribute pair contributes a maximum of 4 × cos45° ≈ 2.8284 units. The total maximum contribution is:\n\n4 + 2.8284 + 2.8284 = 9.6568 ≈ 4 + √32 ≈ 9.6569\n\nThis approach works effectively with equally spaced attributes at 45° intervals but cannot be directly applied when attributes are arranged at different angles in cross-cultural translations.\n\n### SATP Trigonometric Formulation\n\nThe Soundscape Attributes Translation Project (SATP) generalized the approach using a trigonometric formulation to accommodate varying angles and response ranges [@Aletta2024Soundscape]:\n\n$$P_{ISO} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{Pl}}\\sum_{i=1}^{8}\\cos(\\theta_i) \\times \\xi_i$$\n\n$$E_{ISO} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{Ev}}\\sum_{i=1}^{8}\\sin(\\theta_i) \\times \\xi_i$$\n\nWith scaling factors:\n\n$$\\lambda_{Pl} = \\frac{\\rho}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{8}|\\cos(\\theta_i)|$$\n\n$$\\lambda_{Ev} = \\frac{\\rho}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{8}|\\sin(\\theta_i)|$$\n\nWhere:\n\n- $\\theta_i$ is the angle for each circumplex scale\n- $\\xi_i$ is the score for each scale\n- $\\rho$ is the range of possible response values (e.g., $\\rho = 4$ for a 5-point Likert scale)\n\nThis generalization was a significant advancement, but our testing revealed limitations when dealing with uneven angle distributions.\n\n## Identification of Specific Limitations\n\n### Uneven Angle Distribution Problem\n\nIn cross-cultural adaptations, translated attributes may cluster in certain quadrants of the circumplex rather than being evenly distributed. For example, the Indonesian translation has the following angle distribution:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-pdf/cell-3-output-1.pdf){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's implement the original SATP approach to demonstrate the issues:\n\n\n\n### Maximum Value Exceedance Problem\n\nWhen dealing with unevenly spaced attributes, the SATP method can produce coordinates outside the range of [-1, 1] with certain combinations of responses. To demonstrate this, we'll create functions that generate score sets designed to produce maximum/minimum pleasantness and eventfulness:\n\n\n\nTesting with evenly and unevenly spaced angles:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=5}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nWith scores that should produce max_pleasant:\n  Equal angles: P=1.00, E=0.41\n  Uneven angles: P=1.00, E=-0.25\n\nWith scores that should produce min_pleasant:\n  Equal angles: P=-1.00, E=-0.41\n  Uneven angles: P=-1.00, E=0.88\n\nWith scores that should produce max_eventful:\n  Equal angles: P=0.00, E=1.00\n  Uneven angles: P=0.02, E=1.31\n\nWith scores that should produce min_eventful:\n  Equal angles: P=-0.00, E=-1.00\n  Uneven angles: P=-0.03, E=-0.69\n\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor the Indonesian angles, the SATP formulation produces a maximum $E_{ISO}$ value of 1.31, exceeding the expected 1.00 bound. Similarly, the minimum $E_{ISO}$ value is only -0.69, not reaching the expected -1.00. This occurs because the angles are unevenly distributed across the positive and negative $E_{ISO}$ hemispheres, with more attributes contributing positively to $E_{ISO}$ than negatively.\n\n### Neutral Score Displacement Issue\n\nAnother critical issue is that neutral scores (all middle values) don't map to the origin (0,0) when angles are unevenly distributed:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=6}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nWith equally spaced angles and neutral scores:\nPleasantness: -0.0000\nEventfulness: 0.0000\n\nWith unevenly spaced angles and neutral scores:\nPleasantness: -0.0028\nEventfulness: 0.3143\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWith evenly spaced angles, neutral scores correctly map to (0,0). However, with unevenly distributed angles, we get non-zero coordinates even with neutral scores, which is problematic for interpretation and cross-cultural comparability.\n\n## Development of Robust Normalization\n\n### Mathematical Derivation from First Principles\n\nTo address these limitations, we developed a new approach that guarantees coordinates within the [-1, +1] range regardless of angle distribution and ensures neutral scores always map to the origin. Our derivation follows a two-stage normalization process:\n\n#### Stage 1: Normalize Scores to [-1, +1]\n\nFor a scale with values in range [min, max], we first normalize all scores to the [-1, +1] range:\n\n1. Center around the midpoint: subtract (min + max)/2\n2. Scale by half the range: divide by (max - min)/2\n\nFor a standard 5-point Likert scale [1, 5], this gives:\n\n$$\\hat{\\xi}_i = \\frac{\\xi_i - 3}{2}$$\n\nThis ensures that neutral scores (e.g., all 3's on a 1-5 scale) are mapped to 0, which is essential for proper origin placement.\n\n#### Stage 2: Project and Scale by Maximum Possible Projection\n\nWe then project these normalized scores using trigonometric functions:\n\n$$P_{raw} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\cos(\\theta_i) \\times \\hat{\\xi_i}$$\n$$E_{raw} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sin(\\theta_i) \\times \\hat{\\xi_i}$$\n\nThe maximum projection in any direction is determined by the sum of absolute trigonometric values:\n\n$$P_{max} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |\\cos(\\theta_i)|$$\n$$E_{max} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |\\sin(\\theta_i)|$$\n\nDividing by these values ensures coordinates stay within [-1, +1]:\n\n$$P_{ISO} = \\frac{P_{raw}}{P_{max}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\cos(\\theta_i) \\times \\hat{\\xi}_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} |\\cos(\\theta_i)|}$$\n\n### Final Formulation\n\nSubstituting our definition of $\\hat{\\xi}_i$ for a general scale with range [min, max]:\n\n$$P_{ISO} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\cos(\\theta_i) \\cdot (\\xi_i - \\mu)}{\\rho \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |\\cos(\\theta_i)|}$$\n\n$$E_{ISO} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sin(\\theta_i) \\cdot (\\xi_i - \\mu)}{\\rho \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |\\sin(\\theta_i)|}$$\n\nWhere:\n\n- $\\mu = \\frac{\\min + \\max}{2}$ is the midpoint of the scale\n- $\\rho = \\frac{\\max - \\min}{2}$ is half the range of the scale\n\n## Implementation and Validation\n\n### Computational Implementation\n\n\n\n### Neutral Score Response Testing\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=8}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nNeutral score handling comparison:\n\nWith equally spaced angles:\nOriginal approach: P=-0.0000, E=0.0000\nRobust approach:   P=0.0000, E=0.0000\n\nWith unevenly spaced angles:\nOriginal approach: P=-0.0028, E=0.3143\nRobust approach:   P=0.0000, E=0.0000\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOur robust approach correctly maps neutral scores to (0,0) regardless of angle distribution, solving the neutral score displacement issue.\n\n### Boundary Condition Verification\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=9}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nBoundary condition tests with equally spaced angles:\nMax Pleasant: 1.0000\nMin Pleasant: -1.0000\nMax Eventful: 1.0000\nMin Eventful: -1.0000\n\nBoundary condition tests with unevenly spaced angles:\nMax Pleasant: 1.0000\nMin Pleasant: -1.0000\nMax Eventful: 1.0000\nMin Eventful: -1.0000\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOur formula correctly maps extreme scores to exactly +1 or -1, regardless of angle distribution, solving the maximum value exceedance problem.\n\n### Compatibility with Original ISO Method\n\nTo verify backward compatibility, we'll compare our approach with the original ISO direct differences method when using evenly spaced angles:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=10}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nCompatibility Statistics (with evenly spaced angles):\n\nPleasantness:\nDirect differences method: mean=-0.0015, std=0.2424\nRobust approach:           mean=-0.0015, std=0.2424\nDifference in means:       0.0000\nRatio of standard deviations: 1.0000\n\nEventfulness:\nDirect differences method: mean=-0.0035, std=0.2385\nRobust approach:           mean=-0.0035, std=0.2385\nDifference in means:       0.0000\nRatio of standard deviations: 1.0000\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-pdf/cell-11-output-2.pdf){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe statistics and visualizations demonstrate that our robust approach produces results that are statistically equivalent to the original ISO direct differences method when using evenly spaced angles, confirming backward compatibility.\n\n### Monte Carlo Simulation\n\nTo thoroughly test our approach against the original SATP method, we'll run a Monte Carlo simulation with thousands of random angle configurations and score combinations:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=11}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nMonte Carlo Simulation Results (5000 iterations):\nOriginal SATP approach out-of-range instances: 1087 (21.74%)\nRobust approach out-of-range instances: 0 (0.00%)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-pdf/cell-12-output-2.pdf){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe simulation results clearly demonstrate that our robust approach guarantees coordinates within the unit circle, while the original SATP approach can produce out-of-range values with certain angle configurations.\n\n## Cross-Cultural Application Analysis\n\nTo evaluate the practical impact of our normalization approach, we'll examine how the two methods affect the positioning of soundscapes using angle configurations from different language translations:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=12}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-pdf/cell-13-output-1.pdf){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis visualization reveals that the choice of normalization approach can significantly affect the relative positioning of soundscapes on the circumplex model across different languages. The robust approach ensures consistent normalization regardless of the angle distribution, which is essential for valid cross-cultural comparisons.\n\n## Technical Discussion and Recommendations\n\n### Mathematical Analysis\n\nOur formula succeeds where the original SATP approach fell short for two key reasons:\n\n1. **Proper Handling of Neutral Scores**: By explicitly subtracting the midpoint of the scale before projection, we ensure that neutral scores always map to the origin (0,0) regardless of angle distribution. With the original approach, neutral scores can produce non-zero coordinates when angles are unevenly distributed.\n\n2. **Correct Scaling for Maximum Projection**: By first normalizing scores to the [-1, +1] range and then dividing by the sum of absolute trigonometric values, we account for the maximum possible projection in both positive and negative directions. This two-stage approach handles uneven angle distributions appropriately.\n\nThe essential mathematical insight is separating the score normalization from the projection normalization. This approach recognizes that the maximum possible projection depends on the absolute sum of trigonometric values, which properly accounts for attributes that might be clustered predominantly in one part of the circumplex.\n\n### Standardization Recommendations\n\nThrough rigorous mathematical derivation and extensive testing, we have developed a robust approach to soundscape normalization that:\n\n1. Guarantees coordinates within the [-1, +1] range for any angle configuration\n2. Correctly maps neutral scores to the origin\n3. Properly handles cross-cultural adaptations with uneven angle distributions\n4. Works for any input scale range\n5. Maintains backward compatibility with the original ISO method\n\nWe recommend adopting this formulation in the revised ISO 12913-3 standard to ensure accurate and comparable soundscape assessment across different languages and cultural contexts. The final formulas:\n\n$$P_{ISO} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\cos(\\theta_i) \\cdot (\\xi_i - \\mu)}{\\rho \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |\\cos(\\theta_i)|}$$\n\n$$E_{ISO} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sin(\\theta_i) \\cdot (\\xi_i - \\mu)}{\\rho \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |\\sin(\\theta_i)|}$$\n\nWhere:\n\n- $\\mu = \\frac{\\min + \\max}{2}$ is the midpoint of the scale\n- $\\rho = \\frac{\\max - \\min}{2}$ is half the range of the scale\n\nThis approach provides a solid mathematical foundation for cross-cultural soundscape research and ensures the validity of the circumplex model in diverse applications.\n\n",
