    Background Previous studies, mainly conducted in laboratory experiments,
    showed there are associations between the perception of acoustic
    environments (ie, soundscapes, as per the International Organization for
    Standardization [ISO] 12913-1:2014 definition) and measures of individual
    health and wellbeing. The aim of this study was to confirm these findings in
    more ecologically realistic settings, by exploring associations between
    soundscapes and wellbeing via a questionnaire campaign.

  abstract: >-
    The implementation of lockdown measures due to the COVID-19 outbreak has
    resulted in wide-ranging social and environmental implications. Among the
    environmental impacts is a decrease in urban noise levels which has so far
    been observed at the city scale via noise mapping efforts conducted through
    the framework of the Environmental Noise Directive. This study aims to
    understand how lockdown measures have manifested at a local level to better
    determine how the person-level experience of the urban soundscape has been
    affected and how these affects differ across urban space typologies. Taking
    London as a case study, a series of 30-second binaural recordings were taken
    at 11 locations representing a cross-section of urban public spaces with
    varying compositions of sound sources during Spring 2019 (pre-lockdown, N =
    620) and Spring 2020 (during-lockdown, N = 481). Five acoustic and
    psychoacoustic metrics (LAeq, LA10, LA90, Loudness, Sharpness) were
    calculated for each recording and their changes from the pre-lockdown
    scenario to the lockdown scenario are investigated. Clustering analysis was
    performed which grouped the locations into 3 types of urban settings based
    on their acoustic characteristics. An average reduction of 5.4 dB (LAeq) was
    observed, however significant differences in the degree of reduction were
    found across the locations, ranging from a 10.7 dB to a 1.2 dB reduction.
    This study confirms the general reduction in noise levels due to the
    nationally imposed lockdown measures, identifies trends which vary depending
    on the urban context and discusses the implications for the limits of urban
    noise reduction.

    The influence of cultural background on the soundscape experience in public
    spaces has been widely acknowledged. However, most studies have not used
    standardized protocols for soundscape perception data collection, nor have
    they gathered large datasets across different regions of the world to
    investigate possible cultural differences. This study explored the
    relationships between soundscape descriptors, perceived dominance of sound
    sources, and overall soundscape qualities and whether these relationships
    differ across world regions. A database of over 2000 soundscape surveys was
    collected in situ in outdoor public spaces in Europe and China. Results
    highlighted differences in how European and Chinese participants perceived
    the pleasantness and dominance of different sound sources. Specifically, the
    positive correlation between perceived pleasantness and natural sounds was
    stronger for European participants. For Chinese participants, vibrant
    soundscapes were positively correlated with perceived dominance of natural
    sounds, whereas in Europe, they were associated more with human-generated
    sounds. Perceived loudness had a greater effect on the appropriateness
    dimension for the Chinese sample than that for the European sample. This
    study provides a deeper understanding of how the geographical/cultural
    context can influence soundscape perception in public spaces and suggests
    that such country-specific factors should be considered when designing urban
    soundscapes.

    This paper presents the outcomes of the “Soundscape Attributes Translation
    Project” (SATP), an international initiative addressing the critical
    research gap in soundscape descriptors translations for cross-cultural
    studies. Focusing on eighteen languages – namely: Arabic, Chinese, Croatian,
    Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese,
    Korean, Malay, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, and Vietnamese – the
    study employs a four-step procedure to evaluate the reliability and
    cross-cultural validity of translated soundscape descriptors. The study
    introduces a three-tier confidence level system (Low, Medium, High) based on
    “adjusted angles”, which are a measure proposed to correct the soundscape
    circumplex model (i.e., the pleasant-eventful space proposed in the ISO
    12913 series) of a given language. Results reveal that most languages
    successfully maintain the quasi-circumplex structure of the original
    soundscape model, ensuring robust cross-cultural validity. English, Arabic,
    Chinese (Mandarin), Croatian, Dutch, German, Greek, Indonesian, Italian,
    Spanish, Swedish, and Turkish achieve a “High” confidence level. French,
    Japanese, Korean, Malay, Portuguese, and Vietnamese demonstrate varying
    confidence levels, highlighting the importance of the preliminary
    translation. This research significantly contributes to standardized
    cross-cultural methodologies in soundscape perception research, emphasizing
    the pivotal role of adjusted angles within the soundscape circumplex model
    in ensuring the accuracy of dimensions (i.e., attributes) locations. The
    SATP initiative offers insights into the complex interplay of language and
    meaning in the perception of environmental sounds, opening avenues for
    further cross-cultural soundscape research.

    In recent decades, there has been a growing interest in urban soundscapes
    and a shift towards a user-focused approach in urban sound environments.
    Despite this interest, there is no comprehensive taxonomy for soundscape
    design available. The Catalogue of Soundscape Interventions (CSI) project
    aims to fill this gap by creating a tool to collect and share data on real
    soundscape practices, with the goal of developing a design toolkit and brief
    to facilitate communication between local authorities, consultants, and
    researchers. An online platform has been launched to gather instances of
    soundscape interventions. This paper proposes eight dimensions of soundscape
    interventions and presents a taxonomy that categorizes these interventions
    based on recurring strategies and goals observed in 43 practice cases
    collected. These dimensions include stages, contributors, scale, period of
    time, intervention types, public involvement, aims and purposes, and
    approaches. As soundscape practices increase in complexity and variety, the
    taxonomy can be revised and expanded. Nevertheless, the provided taxonomy
    serves as an orientation aid for understanding, analyzing, and designing
    soundscapes, leading to the development of more harmonious and contextually
    appropriate acoustic environments.

  abstract: >-
    The soundscape is deﬁned by the International Standard Organization (ISO)
    12913-1 as the human’s perception of the acoustic environment, in context,
    accompanying physiological and psychological responses. Previous research is
    synthesized with studies designed to investigate soundscape at the
    ‘unconscious’ level in an eﬀort to more speciﬁcally conceptualize biomarkers
    of the soundscape. This review aims ﬁrstly, to investigate the consistency
    of methodologies applied for the investigation of physiological aspects of
    soundscape; secondly, to underline the feasibility of physiological markers
    as biomarkers of soundscape; and ﬁnally, to explore the association between
    the physiological responses and the well-founded psychological components of
    the soundscape which are continually advancing. For this review, Web of
    Science, PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO were searched for peer-reviewed
    articles published in English with combinations of the keywords
    ‘soundscape’, ‘environmental noise/sound’, ‘physiology/physiological’,
    ‘psychology/psychological’, and ‘perceptual attributes/aﬀective/subjective
    assessment/appraisals’. Previous research suggests that Electrocardiography
    (ECG) and Vectorcardiography (VCG) biometrics quantifying Heart Rate (HR),
    stimulus-locked experimental design, and passive listening with homogeneous
    populations are predominantly applied to characterize the psychophysiology
    underlying the soundscape. Pleasantness and arousal are the most frequent
    psychological descriptors for soundscape subjective appraisals. Likewise,
    acoustic environments are reported to inconsistently evoke physiological
    responses with great variability among studies. The link between the
    perceptual attributes and physiological responses of soundscape vary within
    and among existing literature. While a few studies detected a link between
    physiological manifestations of soundscape and the perceptual attributes,
    the others failed to validate this link. Additionally, the majority of the
    study ﬁndings were limited to one or two physiological responses.

    Abstract
              There is a great deal of literature on contributing environmental factors of soundscape, the perception of the acoustic environment by humans in context. Yet the impact of some contextual and person-related factors is largely unknown. From the questionnaire, adapted from ISO12913-2 and the WHO-5 well-being index, three questions arose: are there differences in Pleasantness and Eventfulness of soundscape among different acoustic environments; are high levels of psychological well-being associated with increased Pleasantness and Eventfulness ratings; and is soundscape Pleasantness and Eventfulness consistent among different age and gender groups? The sample comprised 1180 individual questionnaires, 621 females (52.6%), 532 males (45.1%), mean age 34.95 years ± 15.62, collected from eleven urban locations. Hierarchical clustering analysis was done on the mean of each sound source question for each survey location resulting in three clusters of locations based on sound source composition: Natural-dominant, Traffic-dominant and Mixed-sources. A Kruskal-Wallis was conducted to compare the mean Pleasantness and Eventfulness scores of the three clusters, demonstrating that the soundscape assessment was significantly different depending on sound source composition. Multiple linear regression models were used to analyse the relationship between psychological well-being, age, and gender with soundscape Pleasantness and Eventfulness. Our results indicated first that the positive psychological state was associated with Pleasantness in the all-locations and mixed-sources clusters, and with Eventfulness in the traffic-dominant cluster. Secondly, while age was linked to Pleasantness in all clusters it was merely associated with the Eventfulness in the all-locations cluster. Lastly, gender was associated with Pleasantness only in the all-locations cluster. These findings offer empirical grounds for developing theories of the contextual factors on soundscape.

    Soundscape studies aim to consider the holistic human perception of a sound
    environment, including both the physical phenomena and how these are
    mediated by internal factors. This study aims to assess the influence of
    psychological well-being and demographic factors including age, gender,
    occupation status, and education levels on the dimensions of the soundscape
    circumplex, i.e., Pleasantness and Eventfulness. Data was collected in
    eleven urban locations in London through a large-scale (N = 1134) soundscape
    survey according to the ISO 12913-2 technical specifications and
    incorporating the WHO-5 well-being index. Linear mixed-effects modelling
    applying backwards-step feature selection was used to model the interactions
    between internal factors including psychological well-being, age, gender,
    occupation status, education levels and the soundscape Pleasantness and
    Eventfulness, while accounting for the random effects of the survey
    location. The findings suggest that internal factors account for
    approximately 1.4% of the variance for Pleasantness and 3.9% for
    Eventfulness, while the influence of the locations accounted for
    approximately 34% and 14%, respectively. Psychological well-being is
    positively associated with perceived Pleasantness, while there is a negative
    association with Eventfulness only for males. Occupation status, in
    particular retirement as a proxy of age and gender, was identified as a
    significant factor for both dimensions. These findings offer empirical
    grounds for developing theories of the interaction between internal factors
    and soundscape formation whilst highlighting the importance of the location,
    namely: the context.

    This study examines the association between appropriateness and the
    pleasantness-eventfulness circumplex model, as well as the influencing
    environmental and personal factors, in accordance with the recommended
    questionnaire of ISO/TS 12913-2 (2018). A database was used, containing over
    1000 soundscape surveys collected across eleven locations in London.
    Confirmatory factor analysis and the structural summary method were applied
    to validate the relationship between appropriateness and the
    pleasantness-eventfulness circumplex model, while linear multilevel models
    were developed to investigate the effect of personal and environmental
    factors on appropriateness. The findings highlight varying relationship
    between appropriateness and the pleasantness-eventfulness dimensions of the
    soundscape circumplex model. The effect of personal factors on
    appropriateness is not negligible, accounting for approximately 2.1% of the
    variance. In contrast to the effects of the categories of landscape
    composition and acoustic metrics, dominant sound source type is the most
    influential category of environmental factors, with natural sounds
    explaining the most variance at 6%. Traffic noise is negatively associated
    with appropriateness which varies by location, while human sounds are
    negatively associated with appropriateness when respondents were Asian/Asian
    British. The findings provide empirical evidence of the relationship between
    appropriateness and the soundscape circumplex model and offer comprehensive
    insights into the affecting factors.

  abstract: >-
    Soundscape studies typically attempt to capture the perception and
    understanding of sonic environments by surveying users. However, for
    long-term monitoring or assessing interventions, sound-signal-based
    approaches are required. To this end, most previous research focused on
    psycho-acoustic quantities or automatic sound recognition. Few attempts were
    made to include appraisal (e.g., in circumplex frameworks). This paper
    proposes an artificial intelligence (AI)-based dual-branch convolutional
    neural network with cross-attention-based fusion (DCNN-CaF) to analyze
    automatic soundscape characterization, including sound recognition and
    appraisal. Using the DeLTA dataset containing human-annotated sound source
    labels and perceived annoyance, the DCNN-CaF is proposed to perform sound
    source classification (SSC) and human-perceived annoyance rating prediction
    (ARP). Experimental findings indicate that (1) the proposed DCNN-CaF using
    loudness and Mel features outperforms the DCNN-CaF using only one of them.
    (2) The proposed DCNN-CaF with cross-attention fusion outperforms other
    typical AI-based models and soundscape-related traditional machine learning
    methods on the SSC and ARP tasks. (3) Correlation analysis reveals that the
    relationship between sound sources and annoyance is similar for humans and
    the proposed AI-based DCNN-CaF model. (4) Generalization tests show that the
    proposed model's ARP in the presence of model-unknown sound sources is
    consistent with expert expectations and can explain previous findings from
    the literature on soundscape augmentation.

  abstract: >-
    Acoustic scene classification (ASC) can be helpful for creating context
    awareness for intelligent robots. Humans naturally use the relations between
    acoustic scenes (AS) and audio events (AE) to understand and recognize their
    surrounding environments. However, in most previous works, ASC and audio
    event classification (AEC) are treated as independent tasks, with a focus
    primarily on audio features shared between scenes and events, but not their
    implicit relations. To address this limitation, we propose a cooperative
    scene-event modelling (cSEM) framework to automatically model the intricate
    scene-event relation by an adaptive coupling matrix to improve ASC. Compared
    with other scene-event modelling frameworks, the proposed cSEM offers the
    following advantages. First, it reduces the confusion between similar scenes
    by aligning the information of coarse-grained AS and fine-grained AE in the
    latent space, and reducing the redundant information between the AS and AE
    embeddings. Second, it exploits the relation information between AS and AE
    to improve ASC, which is shown to be beneficial, even if the information of
    AE is derived from unverified pseudo-labels. Third, it uses a
    regression-based loss function for cooperative modelling of scene-event
    relations, which is shown to be more effective than classification-based
    loss functions. Instantiated from four models based on either Transformer or
    convolutional neural networks, cSEM is evaluated on real-life and synthetic
    datasets. Experiments show that cSEM-based models work well in real-life
    scene-event analysis, offering competitive results on ASC as compared with
    other multi-feature or multi-model ensemble methods. The ASC accuracy
    achieved on the TUT2018, TAU2019, and JSSED datasets is 81.0%, 88.9% and
    97.2%, respectively.

  abstract: >-
    We live in a rich and varied acoustic world, which is experienced by
    individuals or communities as a soundscape. Computational auditory scene
    analysis, disentangling acoustic scenes by detecting and classifying events,
    focuses on objective attributes of sounds, such as their category and
    temporal characteristics, ignoring their effects on people, such as the
    emotions they evoke within a context. To fill this gap, we propose the
    soundscape captioning task, which enables automated soundscape analysis,
    thus avoiding labour-intensive subjective ratings and surveys in
    conventional methods. With soundscape captioning, context-aware descriptions
    are generated for soundscape by capturing the acoustic scene, event
    information, and the corresponding human affective qualities (AQs). To this
    end, we propose an automatic soundscape captioner (SoundSCaper) system
    composed of an acoustic model, i.e. SoundAQnet, and a large language model
    (LLM). SoundAQnet simultaneously models multi-scale information about
    acoustic scenes, events, and perceived AQs, while the LLM describes the
    soundscape with captions by parsing the information captured with
    SoundAQnet. The soundscape caption's quality is assessed by a jury of 16
    audio/soundscape experts. The average score (out of 5) of
    SoundSCaper-generated captions is lower than the score of captions generated
    by two soundscape experts by 0.21 and 0.25, respectively, on the evaluation
    set and the model-unknown mixed external dataset with varying lengths and
    acoustic properties, but the differences are not statistically significant.
    Overall, the proposed SoundSCaper shows promising performance, with captions
    generated being comparable to those annotated by soundscape experts. The
    code of models, LLM scripts, human assessment data and instructions, and
    expert evaluation statistics are all publicly available.

    The growing field of soundscape studies considers sound environments as
    perceived, in context, with an interdisciplinary approach. This paper
    outlines an ongoing European Research Council (ERC) Advanced Grant project,
    which aims to establish “soundscape indices” (SSID). By taking
    psychological, (psycho)acoustical, neural and physiological, and contextual
    factors into account, SSID will adequately reflect levels of human comfort
    to integrate side-by-side with (and eventually replace) decibel-based
    metrics into existing (international) regulations, shifting the focus from
    noise control to a more holistic approach. Steps to achieve this include: to
    characterise soundscapes, by capturing acoustic environments and
    establishing a comprehensive database; to identify key factors and their
    influence on soundscape quality based on the database, by conducting
    laboratory psychological evaluations, acoustical/psychoacoustic factors
    analysis, and also, to research the neural and psychophysiological
    underpinnings of soundscape experience, by applying techniques such as
    functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Skin Conductance Response
    (SCR); to develop, test and validate the soundscape indices, by analysing
    the influences of various factors; to demonstrate the applicability of the
    soundscape indices in practice, by establishing frameworks for soundscape
    prediction, design, and standardisation. Ultimately, the findings of SSID
    will allow for an easy assessment of public spaces and the increase of the
    noise management impact.

  abstract: >-
    Likert scales are useful for collecting data on attitudes and perceptions
    from large samples of people. In particular, they have become a
    well-established tool in soundscape studies for conducting in situ surveys
    to determine how people experience urban public spaces. However, it is still
    unclear whether the metrics of the scales are consistently interpreted
    during a typical assessment task. The current work aims at identifying some
    general trends in the interpretation of Likert scale metrics and introducing
    a procedure for the derivation of metric corrections by analyzing a case
    study dataset of 984 soundscape assessments across 11 urban locations in
    London. According to ISO/TS 12913-2:2018, soundscapes can be assessed
    through the scaling of 8 dimensions: pleasant, annoying, vibrant,
    monotonous, eventful, uneventful, calm, and chaotic. The hypothesis
    underlying this study is that a link exists between correlations across the
    percentage of assessments falling in each Likert scale category and a
    dilation/compression factor affecting the interpretation of the scales
    metric. The outcome of this metric correction value derivation is introduced
    for soundscape, and a new projection of the London soundscapes according to
    the corrected circumplex space is compared with the initial ISO circumplex
    space. The overall results show a general non-equidistant interpretation of
    the scales, particularly on the vibrant-monotonous direction. The
    implications of this correction have been demonstrated through a Linear
    Ridge Classifier task for predicting the London soundscape responses using

    applied to the corrected data. The results suggest that the corrected values
    account for the non-equidistant interpretation of the Likert metrics,
    thereby allowing mathematical operations to be viable when applied to the
    data.

    The field of soundscape studies considers sound environments as perceived,
    in context, and has recently focussed on understanding the potential of
    physical acoustical features, including temporal characteristics, for
    predicting human perception. This study investigates the presence of a 1/f
    structure in the power spectrum slope of six (psycho)acoustical parameters
    of 30-s recordings of urban acoustic environments. The acoustical parameters
    were calculated as time series throughout the recording period, then the
    power spectrum of the time series was calculated and plotted on a log-log
    scale, with the x-axis ranging from 30 s/10-1.5 Hz to 0.01 s/102 Hz. The
    slope of the best-fitted straight line through the power spectrum was
    calculated and compared to the corresponding perceptual attribute ratings of
    the soundscape collected on site during the recording. The dataset includes
    300 + recording-response pairs. An overall 1/f structure was not found for
    any of the parameters. Differences in temporal behaviour are indicated at
    different time scales, with a deviation in slope typically occurring at ∼2
    s/0.5 Hz, reflecting differences in temporal behaviour among
    within-sound-event time scales and between-sound-event time scales. An
    ordinal logistic regression model is developed which predicts the perceptual
    attributes of urban soundscapes based on the spectral slopes of the acoustic
    time series.

    A protocol for characterizing urban soundscapes for use in the design of
    Soundscape Indices (SSID) and general urban research as implemented under
    the European Research Council (ERC)-funded SSID project is described in
    detail. The protocol consists of two stages: (1) a Recording Stage to
    collect audio-visual recordings for further analysis and for use in
    laboratory experiments, and (2) a Questionnaire Stage to collect in situ
    soundscape assessments via a questionnaire method paired with acoustic data
    collection. Key adjustments and improvements to previous methodologies for
    soundscape characterization have been made to enable the collation of data
    gathered from research groups around the world. The data collected under
    this protocol will form a large-scale, international soundscape database.

  abstract: >-
    Noise annoyance has been often reported as one of the main adverse effects
    of noise exposure on human health, and there is consensus that it relates to
    several factors going beyond the mere energy content of the signal. Research
    has historically focused on a limited set of sound sources (e.g., transport
    and industrial noise); only more recently is attention being given to more
    holistic aspects of urban acoustic environments and the role they play in
    the noise annoyance perceptual construct. This is the main approach promoted
    in soundscape studies, looking at both wanted and unwanted sounds. In this
    study, three specific aspects were investigated, namely: (1) the effect of
    different sound sources combinations, (2) the number of sound sources
    present in the soundscape, and (3) the presence of individual sound source,
    on noise annoyance perception. For this purpose, a large-scale online
    experiment was carried out with 1.2k+ participants, using 2.8k+ audio
    recordings of complex urban acoustic environments to investigate how they
    would influence the perceived noise annoyance. Results showed that: (1) the
    combinations of different sound sources were not important, compared,
    instead, to the number of sound sources identified in the soundscape
    recording (regardless of sound sources type); (2) the annoyance ratings
    expressed a minimum when any two clearly distinguishable sound sources were
    present in a given urban soundscape; and (3) the presence (either in
    isolation or combination) of traffic-related sound sources increases noise
    annoyance, while the presence (either in isolation or combination) of
    nature-related sound sources decreases noise annoyance.

  abstract: >-
    With the recent standardization of soundscape, there has been increased
    interest in bringing the soundscape approach into an engineering context.
    While traditional assessment methods, such as those given in the ISO 12913
    series, provide information on the current status quo of an environment,
     they offer limited insight into hypothetical environments and are therefore less relevant for design purposes. This conference paper presents a conceptual framework for the practical use of predictive soundscape models and indices. The framework outlines the goals, constraints, and potential
     applications of these models and highlights the need for further research in this area to better understand the dynamics of soundscape perception and to put predictive models to practical use. Predictive soundscape models can be integrated with soundscape indices - such as those being developed
     by the Soundscape Indices (SSID) project - for assessment purposes, providing a comprehensive approach to evaluating and designing sound environments. The use of predictive models is necessary to address the challenges faced in practical applications of the soundscape approach and to fill
     the gap between traditional assessment methods and the design of sound environments.

    Nearly 10 years ago, the definition of soundscape was codified in an ISO
    standard for the first time. This definition drew from Schafer and
    Southworth's work, which focused squarely on human perception in context.
    However, the term soundscape has seen widespread academic and popular
    adoption in fields and applications well outside its original 'human
    perception' context. This paper will collect a range of definitions of
    soundscape across urban, underwater, ecological and other contexts. These
    uses often conflict with the ISO 12913 definition, both by drawing the focus
    away from humans and by declining to define soundscape as a perceptual
    construct. This paper will examine these broader uses of the term and
    consider a possible new definition which aims to reemphasise soundscape's
    relation to landscape and harmonise the standard definition with its varied

  abstract: >-
    The soundscape approach provides a basis for considering the holistic
    perception of sound environments in context. Whereas steady advancements
    have been made in methods for assessment and analysis, a gap exists for
    comparing soundscapes and quantifying improvements in the multidimensional
    perception of a soundscape. To this end, there is a need for the creation of
    single value indices to compare soundscape quality which incorporate
    context, aural diversity, and specific design goals for a given application.
    Just as a variety of decibel-based indices have been developed for various
    purposes (e.g.,  LAeq,  LCeq,  L90,  Lden, etc.), the soundscape approach
    requires the ability to create original indices for different uses, which
    share a common language and understanding. Therefore, a unified framework
    for creating bespoke and reference single index measures of soundscape
    perception is proposed, allowing for different metrics to be defined in the
    future. This framework is based on a four-step test-target paradigm wherein
    a desired soundscape perception is defined as a target distribution within
    the soundscape circumplex, and the two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov
    distance is used to test an assessed soundscape against this target.
    Applications and implications of this framework are discussed, and a
    multi-objective optimisation method for empirically defining perception
    indices is proposed.

    Soundscape questionnaires are widely used to gather subjective information
    about people's perceptions and attitudes towards their acoustic environment.
    Despite the widespread adoption of ISO/TS 12913-3 guidelines for analyzing
    soundscape survey data, there are still several interpretations
     and challenges in application. To enable the easy, accessible, and consistent analysis of soundscape data, an open-source python package called Soundscapy has been developed. This package implements a visualization approach for soundscape data analysis using a probabilistic method that depicts
     the collective perception of a soundscape as a distribution of responses within the circumplex. In addition, functions for psychoacoustic and acoustic analysis of binaural data are included, with a focus on consistent and optimized processing of multiple recordings. This conference paper outlines
     the important features of Soundscapy, explains its basic functioning, lists its current capabilities, and gives recommendations for its best use. Finally, the future development of Soundscapy is proposed, including the integration of predictive soundscape models for use in automated assessment
     and design.

  abstract: >-
    In recent years, various stakeholders and political decision-makers have
    recognized the significance of high-quality urban sound environments,
    stressing the need for user-centered trajectories. Despite the rising
    interest in this field, the soundscape approach has not yet fully permeated
    urban planning and design, possibly due to a lack of comprehensible
    guidelines on how to implement and curate successful soundscape designs,
    attributed to on-going developments on this subject. In the course of the
    Catalogue of Soundscape Interventions (CSI) Project, a taxonomy of eight
    dimensions was developed to serve as an orientation aid for practitioners,
    describing important aspects of soundscape-related measures that can be used
    as a brief to facilitate communication between authorities, consultants, and
    researchers. This study describes the theoretical framework and, in
    particular, the sequential coding process involved in deriving these
    dimensions, which is based on grounded theory. It lists observations and
    limitations of the resulting taxonomy and builds upon these findings to
    critically review and revisit existing nomenclature and concepts. Finally, a
    qualitative distinction in the form of a design pyramid according to
    ascending levels of epistemic rigor is proposed, to differentiate between
    documented practices, which may serve as a reference point for future
    harmonization and standardization.

    The recent development and deployment of Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks
    (WASN) present new ways to address urban acoustic challenges in a smart city
    context. A focus on improving quality of life forms the core of smart-city
    design paradigms and cannot be limited to simply measuring objective
    environmental factors, but should also consider the perceptual,
    psychological and health impacts on citizens. This study therefore makes use
    of short (1–2.7 s) recordings sourced from a WASN in Milan which were
    grouped into various environmental sound source types and given an annoyance
    rating via an online survey with N=100 participants. A multilevel
    psychoacoustic model was found to achieve an overall R2=0.64 which
    incorporates Sharpness as a fixed effect regardless of the sound source type
    and Roughness, Impulsiveness and Tonality as random effects whose
    coefficients vary depending on the sound source. These results present a
    promising step toward implementing an on-sensor annoyance model which
    incorporates psychoacoustic features and sound source type, and is
    ultimately not dependent on sound level.

    Many cities around the world have claimed that the enforcement of lockdown
    measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 and the corresponding limitations
    of human activities led to reduced environmental noise levels. However,
    noise complaints reported by many local authorities were on the rise soon
    after the local lockdowns came into force. This research took Greater London
    in the UK as a case study. The overall aim was examining how noise
    complaints changed during the first stages of the lockdown implementation,
    during Spring 2020, both locally and at city scale, and how urban factors
    may have been influencing them. Noise complaint and urban factor datasets
    from the Government's publicly available data warehouse were used. The
    results show that during the COVID-19 lockdown the number of noise
    complaints increased by 48%, compared with the same period during Spring
    2019. In terms of noise sources, complaints about construction (36%) and
    neighbourhood (50%) noise showed significant increases. Urban factors,
    including housing and demographic factors, played a more significant role
    than the actual noise exposure to road and rail traffic noise, as derived
    from the London noise maps. In detail, the change rate of noise complaints
    was higher in areas with higher unemployment rates, more residents with no
    qualifications, and lower house price. It is expected that this study could
    help government with allocating resources more effectively and achieve a
    better urban environment.

    Soundscape assessments by citizens are starting to emerge as a common
    practice, normally carried out in context by means of soundwalks along
    selected paths with volunteers. However, when such assessments are carried
    out, either in situ or in laboratory experiments, visually impaired citizens
    are not usually involved. To address this question, three soundwalks were
    carried out in 2020 in the city of Granada, in southern Spain, with the
    participation of visually impaired people. In this paper, we present the
    lessons learnt from this research with respect to the methodology issues
    that have to do with soundwalking and the surveying procedures when people
    with limited vison are participating, the assessment results, and a
    comparison with a soundscape evaluation carried out in 2019 without the
    collaboration of visually impaired people. The results of this preliminary
    campaign highlight that: (1) Adapting soundscape assessment protocols from
    standards for visually impaired people is a methodological challenge that
    requires research attention; (2) Some of the different patterns in the
    assessment of the soundscape pleasantness between visually impaired and
    nonvisually impaired participants emerged; (3) The perception of quietness
    may differ for visually impaired people when orientation and identification
    are factors that play a role in the acoustic environment evaluation.

  abstract: >-
    In soundscape studies there is a need to validate the ISO 12913 framework
    and questionnaire protocols in non-English speaking regions, which is being
    addressed via an international translation effort carried out within the
    Soundscape Attributes Translation Project (SATP). The objective of the SATP
    initiative is to promote the widespread use of the soundscape circumplex
    model attributes by validating proposed translations using standardized
    listening experiments in different languages and geographical regions. This
    study compares the Spanish (ISO 639:spa) translation of the ISO soundscape
    circumplex model with the original English version and introduces the
    Structural Summary Method (SSM) for analysis. The research findings suggest
    a reasonable accordance in listening experiments carried out by native
    English and Spanish speakers, but also highlight the need for revision of
    the “vibrant/monotonous” and “eventful/uneventful” dimensions to harmonize
    the interpretation of each dimension by the affected population. These
    revisions not only improve the translation of the model into Spanish, but
    also raise questions about the adequacy of the original English formulation
    of the model. The study underscores the cultural differences underlying the
    meaning of these dimensions and the challenges of objectifying the
    soundscape circumplex model within the ISO 12913 framework.
