  abstract       = {The implementation of lockdown measures due to the COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in wide-ranging social and environmental implications. Among the environmental impacts is a decrease in urban noise levels which has so far been observed at the city scale via noise mapping efforts conducted through the framework of the Environmental Noise Directive. This study aims to understand how lockdown measures have manifested at a local level to better determine how the person-level experience of the urban soundscape has been affected and how these affects differ across urban space typologies. Taking London as a case study, a series of 30-second binaural recordings were taken at 11 locations representing a cross-section of urban public spaces with varying compositions of sound sources during Spring 2019 (pre-lockdown, N = 620) and Spring 2020 (during-lockdown, N = 481). Five acoustic and psychoacoustic metrics (LAeq, LA10, LA90, Loudness, Sharpness) were calculated for each recording and their changes from the pre-lockdown scenario to the lockdown scenario are investigated. Clustering analysis was performed which grouped the locations into 3 types of urban settings based on their acoustic characteristics. An average reduction of 5.4 dB (LAeq) was observed, however significant differences in the degree of reduction were found across the locations, ranging from a 10.7 dB to a 1.2 dB reduction. This study confirms the general reduction in noise levels due to the nationally imposed lockdown measures, identifies trends which vary depending on the urban context and discusses the implications for the limits of urban noise reduction.},

However, most studies have not used standardized protocols for soundscape perception data collection, nor have they gathered large datasets across different regions of the world to investigate possible cultural differences. This study explored the relationships between soundscape descriptors, perceived dominance of sound sources, and overall soundscape qualities and whether these relationships differ across world regions. A database of over 2000 soundscape surveys was collected in situ in outdoor public spaces in Europe and China. Results highlighted differences in how European and Chinese participants perceived the pleasantness and dominance of different sound sources. Specifically, the positive correlation between perceived pleasantness and natural sounds was stronger for European participants. For Chinese participants, vibrant soundscapes were positively correlated with perceived dominance of natural sounds, whereas in Europe, they were associated more with human-generated sounds. Perceived loudness had a greater effect on the appropriateness dimension for the Chinese sample than that for the European sample. This study provides a deeper understanding of how the geographical/cultural context can influence soundscape perception in public spaces and suggests that such country-specific factors should be considered when designing urban soundscapes.}},

Policymakers are increasingly attracted to the concept of soundscapes, as reflected in several documents issued by international agencies that advocate a more user-centred approach when considering the urban acoustic environment. Despite widespread interest in the concept of soundscape, a consensus and systematic review of soundscape design and interventions, as well as a summary of empirical evidence on the benefits of sound methods, are still lacking. The catalogue of soundscape interventions (CSI) project aims to provide a tool for data collection and communication on soundscape practice, with the long-term goal of compiling frequent/recurring soundscape strategies into a “design toolkit” and developing a “design brief” to facilitate communication between local authorities and soundscape consultants and researchers. A platform for collecting examples of soundscape intervention has been published online, and the project is currently in its second phase of populating the example database. When sufficient practices have been gathered, a taxonomy of soundscape design will be developed, which will eventually become a “design toolkit.” To ensure that all perspectives are represented, and the taxonomy is based on consensus, stakeholders will be consulted. If a significant increase in the number of soundscape practices is detected, the taxonomy may require revision.}},

  abstract = {{Soundscape studies typically attempt to capture the perception and understanding of sonic environments by surveying users. However, for long-term monitoring or assessing interventions, sound-signal-based approaches are required. To this end, most previous research focused on psycho-acoustic quantities or automatic sound recognition. Few attempts were made to include appraisal (e.g., in circumplex frameworks). This paper proposes an artificial intelligence (AI)-based dual-branch convolutional neural network with cross-attention-based fusion (DCNN-CaF) to analyze automatic soundscape characterization, including sound recognition and appraisal. Using the DeLTA dataset containing human-annotated sound source labels and perceived annoyance, the DCNN-CaF is proposed to perform sound source classification (SSC) and human-perceived annoyance rating prediction (ARP). Experimental findings indicate that (1) the proposed DCNN-CaF using loudness and Mel features outperforms the DCNN-CaF using only one of them. (2) The proposed DCNN-CaF with cross-attention fusion outperforms other typical AI-based models and soundscape-related traditional machine learning methods on the SSC and ARP tasks. (3) Correlation analysis reveals that the relationship between sound sources and annoyance is similar for humans and the proposed AI-based DCNN-CaF model. (4) Generalization tests show that the proposed model's ARP in the presence of model-unknown sound sources is consistent with expert expectations and can explain previous findings from the literature on soundscape augmentation.}},

In particular, they have become a well-established tool in soundscape studies for conducting in situ surveys to determine how people experience urban public spaces. However, it is still unclear whether the metrics of the scales are consistently interpreted during a typical assessment task. The current work aims at identifying some general trends in the interpretation of Likert scale metrics and introducing a procedure for the derivation of metric corrections by analyzing a case study dataset of 984 soundscape assessments across 11 urban locations in London. According to ISO/TS 12913-2:2018, soundscapes can be assessed through the scaling of 8 dimensions: pleasant, annoying, vibrant, monotonous, eventful, uneventful, calm, and chaotic. The hypothesis underlying this study is that a link exists between correlations across the percentage of assessments falling in each Likert scale category and a dilation/compression factor affecting the interpretation of the scales metric. The outcome of this metric correction value derivation is introduced for soundscape, and a new projection of the London soundscapes according to the corrected circumplex space is compared with the initial ISO circumplex space. The overall results show a general non-equidistant interpretation of the scales, particularly on the vibrant-monotonous direction. The implications of this correction have been demonstrated through a Linear Ridge Classifier task for predicting the London soundscape responses using objective acoustic parameters, which shows significant improvement when applied to the corrected data. The results suggest that the corrected values account for the non-equidistant interpretation of the Likert metrics, thereby allowing mathematical operations to be viable when applied to the data.},

The protocol consists of two stages: (1) a Recording Stage to collect audio-visual recordings for further analysis and for use in laboratory experiments, and (2) a Questionnaire Stage to collect in situ soundscape assessments via a questionnaire method paired with acoustic data collection. Key adjustments and improvements to previous methodologies for soundscape characterization have been made to enable the collation of data gathered from research groups around the world. The data collected under this protocol will form a large-scale, international soundscape database.},
