  abstract: Background Previous studies, mainly conducted in laboratory experiments,
    showed there are associations between the perception of acoustic environments
    (ie, soundscapes, as per the International Organization for Standardization [ISO]
    12913-1:2014 definition) and measures of individual health and wellbeing. The
    aim of this study was to confirm these findings in more ecologically realistic
    settings, by exploring associations between soundscapes and wellbeing via a questionnaire
    campaign.

  abstract: The implementation of lockdown measures due to the COVID-19 outbreak has
    resulted in wide-ranging social and environmental implications. Among the environmental
    impacts is a decrease in urban noise levels which has so far been observed at
    the city scale via noise mapping efforts conducted through the framework of the
    Environmental Noise Directive. This study aims to understand how lockdown measures
    have manifested at a local level to better determine how the person-level experience
    of the urban soundscape has been affected and how these affects differ across
    urban space typologies. Taking London as a case study, a series of 30-second binaural
    recordings were taken at 11 locations representing a cross-section of urban public
    spaces with varying compositions of sound sources during Spring 2019 (pre-lockdown,
    N = 620) and Spring 2020 (during-lockdown, N = 481). Five acoustic and psychoacoustic
    metrics (LAeq, LA10, LA90, Loudness, Sharpness) were calculated for each recording
    and their changes from the pre-lockdown scenario to the lockdown scenario are
    investigated. Clustering analysis was performed which grouped the locations into
    3 types of urban settings based on their acoustic characteristics. An average
    reduction of 5.4 dB (LAeq) was observed, however significant differences in the
    degree of reduction were found across the locations, ranging from a 10.7 dB to
    a 1.2 dB reduction. This study confirms the general reduction in noise levels
    due to the nationally imposed lockdown measures, identifies trends which vary
    depending on the urban context and discusses the implications for the limits of
    urban noise reduction.

  abstract: The influence of cultural background on the soundscape experience in public
    spaces has been widely acknowledged. However, most studies have not used standardized
    protocols for soundscape perception data collection, nor have they gathered large
    datasets across different regions of the world to investigate possible cultural
    differences. This study explored the relationships between soundscape descriptors,
    perceived dominance of sound sources, and overall soundscape qualities and whether
    these relationships differ across world regions. A database of over 2000 soundscape
    surveys was collected in situ in outdoor public spaces in Europe and China. Results
    highlighted differences in how European and Chinese participants perceived the
    pleasantness and dominance of different sound sources. Specifically, the positive
    correlation between perceived pleasantness and natural sounds was stronger for
    European participants. For Chinese participants, vibrant soundscapes were positively
    correlated with perceived dominance of natural sounds, whereas in Europe, they
    were associated more with human-generated sounds. Perceived loudness had a greater
    effect on the appropriateness dimension for the Chinese sample than that for the
    European sample. This study provides a deeper understanding of how the geographical/cultural
    context can influence soundscape perception in public spaces and suggests that
    such country-specific factors should be considered when designing urban soundscapes.

  abstract: Over the past 20 years, there has been a significant increase in soundscape
    studies focusing on urban scenarios. Policymakers are increasingly attracted to
    the concept of soundscapes, as reflected in several documents issued by international
    agencies that advocate a more user-centred approach when considering the urban
    acoustic environment. Despite widespread interest in the concept of soundscape,
    a consensus and systematic review of soundscape design and interventions, as well
    as a summary of empirical evidence on the benefits of sound methods, are still
    lacking. The catalogue of soundscape interventions (CSI) project aims to provide
    a tool for data collection and communication on soundscape practice, with the
    long-term goal of compiling frequent/recurring soundscape strategies into a “design
    toolkit” and developing a “design brief” to facilitate communication between local
    authorities and soundscape consultants and researchers. A platform for collecting
    examples of soundscape intervention has been published online, and the project
    is currently in its second phase of populating the example database. When sufficient
    practices have been gathered, a taxonomy of soundscape design will be developed,
    which will eventually become a “design toolkit.” To ensure that all perspectives
    are represented, and the taxonomy is based on consensus, stakeholders will be
    consulted. If a significant increase in the number of soundscape practices is
    detected, the taxonomy may require revision.

  abstract: Soundscape studies typically attempt to capture the perception and understanding
    of sonic environments by surveying users. However, for long-term monitoring or
    assessing interventions, sound-signal-based approaches are required. To this end,
    most previous research focused on psycho-acoustic quantities or automatic sound
    recognition. Few attempts were made to include appraisal (e.g., in circumplex
    frameworks). This paper proposes an artificial intelligence (AI)-based dual-branch
    convolutional neural network with cross-attention-based fusion (DCNN-CaF) to analyze
    automatic soundscape characterization, including sound recognition and appraisal.
    Using the DeLTA dataset containing human-annotated sound source labels and perceived
    annoyance, the DCNN-CaF is proposed to perform sound source classification (SSC)
    and human-perceived annoyance rating prediction (ARP). Experimental findings indicate
    that (1) the proposed DCNN-CaF using loudness and Mel features outperforms the
    DCNN-CaF using only one of them. (2) The proposed DCNN-CaF with cross-attention
    fusion outperforms other typical AI-based models and soundscape-related traditional
    machine learning methods on the SSC and ARP tasks. (3) Correlation analysis reveals
    that the relationship between sound sources and annoyance is similar for humans
    and the proposed AI-based DCNN-CaF model. (4) Generalization tests show that the
    proposed model's ARP in the presence of model-unknown sound sources is consistent
    with expert expectations and can explain previous findings from the literature
    on soundscape augmentation.

  abstract: 'Likert scales are useful for collecting data on attitudes and perceptions
    from large samples of people. In particular, they have become a well-established
    tool in soundscape studies for conducting in situ surveys to determine how people
    experience urban public spaces. However, it is still unclear whether the metrics
    of the scales are consistently interpreted during a typical assessment task. The
    current work aims at identifying some general trends in the interpretation of
    Likert scale metrics and introducing a procedure for the derivation of metric
    corrections by analyzing a case study dataset of 984 soundscape assessments across
    11 urban locations in London. According to ISO/TS 12913-2:2018, soundscapes can
    be assessed through the scaling of 8 dimensions: pleasant, annoying, vibrant,
    monotonous, eventful, uneventful, calm, and chaotic. The hypothesis underlying
    this study is that a link exists between correlations across the percentage of
    assessments falling in each Likert scale category and a dilation/compression factor
    affecting the interpretation of the scales metric. The outcome of this metric
    correction value derivation is introduced for soundscape, and a new projection
    of the London soundscapes according to the corrected circumplex space is compared
    with the initial ISO circumplex space. The overall results show a general non-equidistant
    interpretation of the scales, particularly on the vibrant-monotonous direction.
    The implications of this correction have been demonstrated through a Linear Ridge
    Classifier task for predicting the London soundscape responses using objective
    acoustic parameters, which shows significant improvement when applied to the corrected
    data. The results suggest that the corrected values account for the non-equidistant
    interpretation of the Likert metrics, thereby allowing mathematical operations
    to be viable when applied to the data.'

  abstract: 'A protocol for characterizing urban soundscapes for use in the design
    of Soundscape Indices (SSID) and general urban research as implemented under the
    European Research Council (ERC)-funded SSID project is described in detail. The
    protocol consists of two stages: (1) a Recording Stage to collect audio-visual
    recordings for further analysis and for use in laboratory experiments, and (2)
    a Questionnaire Stage to collect in situ soundscape assessments via a questionnaire
    method paired with acoustic data collection. Key adjustments and improvements
    to previous methodologies for soundscape characterization have been made to enable
    the collation of data gathered from research groups around the world. The data
    collected under this protocol will form a large-scale, international soundscape
    database.'
