In 2021, I was interviewed by Dr William Tullett of Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge. Dr Tullett created the [Pandemic Sensory Archive](http://www.archiveofintimacy.com/) "to explore bodies and senses through a digital platform, in light of experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic". 

Dr Tullett reached out in relation to my then-recent work investigating how urban soundscapes changed as a result of the COVID-19 lockdowns. I spoke with him about both how the physical sound environment changed and how people's perception was impacted.
