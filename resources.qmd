# Urban Soundscapes

Urban Soundscape Studies pull from a wide range of disciplines, some less known than others. When trying to describe these influences to people, I find myself consistently referring to the same people and references as *examplars*^[Note: These really are just examples I tend to go to. I certainly don't pretend this is every influential reference in the field or even necessarily who I consider better than any other researchers. In fact I will mostly highlight lesser known people that don't tend to be the first points of entry for the field (i.e. I probably won't include Schafer, Jian Kang, or Schult-Fortkamp since there's just too much from them to include). I also apologise to any scholar who feels their work has been miscategorised.] for these various approaches. Mostly these are the sort of references I give people who ask me for an introduction to the different branches of urban soundscape research. Many of these researchers have also appeared on my podcast, [*The Rest Is Just Noise*](https://www.justnoisepod.com/) so check out their interviews there as well!

## Soundscape Engineering

- **ME!** Of course, all of my works and publications can be found here. For my broader concepts, recommendations, and tools for soundscape engineering I would point people to the following specifically:
