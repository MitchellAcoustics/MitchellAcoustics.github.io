::: {#hero-heading}
I am a Lecturer in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Sustainable Construction at the [Bartlett School of Sustainable Construction](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/construction/) at University College London. My research interests include general uses of AI in the construction industry, the application of machine learning methods to environmental analysis, and soundscape engineering.

My current ongoing projects include the Soundscape Indices (SSID) Horizon 2020 project, the [Soundscapy](https://soundscapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Circumplex](https://circumplex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Python packages, and the Soundscape Attributes Translation Project (SATP).

I am also the host of **The Rest is Just Noise**, a monthly podcast exploring the relationship between sound and our cities. Each episode, along with my co-hosts and colleagues Dr Francesco Aletta and Dr Tin Oberman, I speak with researchers and experts from a wide range of backgrounds about their work in urban sounds and sound perception.
